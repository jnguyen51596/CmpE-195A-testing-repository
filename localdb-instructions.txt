I could not set up PostgreSQL using their one click installer, so I had to resort to installing from binaries

1. Download the binaries at: http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgbindownload
I am using version 9.4.1 64 bit

After the download, unzip it wherever you want. I put it on my desktop (c:\users\name\desktop\pgsql\). 
This target directory will be called POSTGRESQL_ROOT from here on out.

2. Create a 'data' and 'log' folder in POSTGRESQL_ROOT

3. Create the database cluster:
navigate to your bin folder (for example: cd c:\users\name\desktop\pgsql\bin)
initdb -U postgres -A password -E utf8 -W -D POSTGRESQL_ROOT\data

If you don't have Visual C++ 2013 runtime installed on your pc, you may get an error:

"The program can't start because MSVCR120.dll is missing from your computer. Try 
reinstalling the program to fix this problem." 
If you get that error, download the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013:
 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784. 
 The vcredist_x86.exe you will need if you are running the 32-bit version of PostgreSQL 9.4 
 and the vcredist_x64.exe is generally the one you want if you are running the 64-bit PostgreSQL 9.4beta1.

4. To start or stop the database:
"POSTGRESQL_ROOT/bin/pg_ctl" -D "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/data" -l "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/log/pgsql.log" start
"POSTGRESQL_ROOT/bin/pg_ctl" -D "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/data" -l "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/log/pgsql.log" stop

5. Add a server in pgAdmin3
Once this is done, you can run pgAdmin3.exe in your bin folder.
Go to file -> add server
name: localhost
host: localhost
port: 5432 (default)
password: optional
store password: I didn't use this option since it warns me that it stores it as plain text

6. Add a database
Once the server is created, you should be able to expand it if everything is running correctly.
Expand localhost, right click databases -> new database

7. Execute queries (create table)
Highlight your newly created database then click the magnifying class icon with the sql label on it.

create table login (
username varchar(20) primary key,
password varchar(20) not null 
);

then hit the play icon at the top
