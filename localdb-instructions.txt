I could not set up PostgreSQL using their one click installer, so I had to resort to installing from binaries.
If you want to try the one click installer: 


ONE CLICK INSTALLER
--------------------------------
1. Download here: http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows

2. Setting up should be straight forward, use default port, default locale, set up your password, etc.
I got an error during installation regarding initialisation cluster.

3. Go to step 5. in installing from binaries instructions. If you can't add the server, consider installing
from binaries. I am not sure what is going on, but I have a suspicion that the database is not being started. 


INSTALLING FROM BINARIES
--------------------------------
1. Download the binaries at: http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgbindownload
I am using version 9.4.1 64 bit

After the download, unzip it wherever you want. I put it on my desktop (c:\users\name\desktop\pgsql\). 
This target directory will be called POSTGRESQL_ROOT from here on out.

2. Create a 'data' and 'log' folder in POSTGRESQL_ROOT

3. Create the database cluster:
navigate to your bin folder (for example: cd c:\users\name\desktop\pgsql\bin)
initdb -U postgres -A password -E utf8 -W -D POSTGRESQL_ROOT\data

If you don't have Visual C++ 2013 runtime installed on your pc, you may get an error:

"The program can't start because MSVCR120.dll is missing from your computer. Try 
reinstalling the program to fix this problem." 
If you get that error, download the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013:
 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784. 
 The vcredist_x86.exe you will need if you are running the 32-bit version of PostgreSQL 9.4 
 and the vcredist_x64.exe is generally the one you want if you are running the 64-bit PostgreSQL 9.4beta1.

4. To start or stop the database:
"POSTGRESQL_ROOT/bin/pg_ctl" -D "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/data" -l "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/log/pgsql.log" start
"POSTGRESQL_ROOT/bin/pg_ctl" -D "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/data" -l "POSTGRESQL_ROOT/log/pgsql.log" stop

5. Add a server in pgAdmin3
Once this is done, you can run pgAdmin3.exe in your bin folder.
Go to file -> add server
name: localhost
host: localhost
port: 5432 (default)
password: optional
store password: I didn't use this option since it warns me that it stores it as plain text

6. Add a database
Once the server is created, you should be able to expand it if everything is running correctly.
Expand localhost, right click databases -> new database

7. Execute queries (create table)
Highlight your newly created database then click the magnifying class icon with the sql label on it.

create table login (
username varchar(20) primary key,
password varchar(20) not null 
);

then hit the play icon at the top

1. Install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

2. Log in as postgres
sudo -i -u postgres

3. Using and creating table
To use postgres prompt, use: 
psql

To view connection info: 
\conninfo

To quit: 
\q

To create database: createdatabase 'name'
where 'name' is 'testDB' in this particular example

To connect to new database: 
psql -d testDB

Creating a table:

create table (
username varchar(20) primary key,
password varchar(20) not null
);

To view newly created table: 
\d
