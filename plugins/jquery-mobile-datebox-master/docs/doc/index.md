# Description
DateBox is a jQueryMobile plugin that aims to make user interaction with dates and
times simple and intuitive. It is a colloborative work, with a full range of features
allowing easy implementation, and painless extensibility.


# Conventions
These demos use a good bit of pseduo-code - remember to look at the page source to
get the whole story.  Also, a few options are locked on for all of these demos, mainly
the control displays "inline" - that is, as part of the page rather than a popup
(the default behavior).  It also has the "new" style forced on for most of the demos
(somewhere under display options I'll show the old method).

I've also specifically turned jQM's Ajax Navigation OFF - this is not because DateBox
has any problems working with correctly when it's enabled, it was purely to make
sure that bookmarks to specific parts of this documentation are easy to follow


# Navigation
A the top of each page, you can naviagte through this like a giant how-to, or jump
to the Table of Contents
