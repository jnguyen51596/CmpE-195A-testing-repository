# Data Limiting Overview

The reason many people choose to use DateBox over the other available options is
that it includes a massive amount of data limiting controls.  You are able to specify
exactally what is valid data through the control - of course, you should still veriify
data on your end, but for the normal user, this will prevent them from submitting
bad data through ignorance.

Data limiting works in a number of ways - there are options to disallow individual
dates, individual days (such as weekends), recurring dates, or even limit to just
a set of specifcally good data.  Similar options are available for time entry. Additionally
options exist to jump to known good dates, and to highlight preferred dates or days
as needed.
